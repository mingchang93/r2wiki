## Installation
- Clone the repository
> Install using a pyhton3 virtualenv is recommended:
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Echo the following to the `~/.radare2rc` file.
	- To invoke the macros, run them with `.(marcoName [args])`
	
		```
		(r4ge, #!pipe python /pathToClone/src/r4ge.py)
		(markMemSymbolic addr bytes name, #!pipe python /pathToClone/src/createVariable.py symb $0 $1 $2)
		(addHook addr instructions bytes comment, #!pipe python /pathToClone/src/createVariable.py hook $0 $1 $2 $3)
		(addAssert addr assertions comment, #!pipe python /pathToClone/src/createVariable.py assert $0 $1 $2)
		(checkStdout content,  #!pipe python /pathToClone/src/createVariable.py checkstdout $0)
		(createScript name, #!pipe python /pathToClone/src/createScript.py $0)
		(callFunction retval, #!pipe python /pathToClone/src/callFunction.py $0)
		```

## Command description
- `(r4ge)` main plugin file, performs static and dynamic analysis

- `(markMemSymbolic addr bytes name)` mark a specific memory region as symbolic (addr: start address, bytes: how many bytes, name: name the variable)

- `(addHook addr instructions bytes comment)` create hooks in r2 and patch function calls or other statements (syntax of the instructions: rax=0x4 or rax=0x4;rbx=0x10)

- `(addAssert addr assertions comment)` create asserts to check register values during exploration (syntax of the instructions: rax==0x3 or rax#=0x3;rax<=0x10) Note: # is used instead of >, cause r2 uses > as pipe operator.

- `(checkStdout content)` it is also possible to search for a specific string in stdout, just call the makro below. this will ignore find flags, but will consider hooks and asserts. (r2 has many special characters so it may not be possible to put arbitrary strings in the makro but you can modify the r2-variable by your own)

- `(createScript name)` 🚀 create an angr script out of the current r2 session [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/a/s3u2ZFxoDysXcAgPMIVjAhMfK)

- `(callFunction retval)` call a function and specifiy the return value (currently in development mode)

## ipython shell variables

```
proj          ... angr project
start_state   ... start state
pg            ... path_group
state_found   ... result state of exploration
```

## Test Installation

In the testcase folder is binary with an implemented keyschedule, where we have 
to find the key, only the subkeys are left, thats perfect for r4ge.

Follow the instructions from the guide.
